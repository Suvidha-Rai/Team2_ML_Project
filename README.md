Census Income Prediction – 5-Week Machine Learning Project

This repository showcases a 5-week, team-based machine learning project built around the UCI Adult (Census Income) dataset. The goal is to predict whether an individual’s annual income exceeds $50,000 based on demographic and socioeconomic attributes, using end-to-end ML workflows on real-world structured data.

Over five weeks, the project systematically covers:
- Data understanding and variable analysis:
Exploring feature types, distributions, and relationships with the target variable.
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering:
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating informative derived features.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization:
Identifying patterns, class imbalance, and key drivers of income using visual and statistical analysis.
- Model building with supervised learning algorithms:
Training and tuning multiple classification models (e.g., logistic regression, tree-based methods, ensemble models).
- Model evaluation, comparison, and optimization:
  
The project emphasizes collaborative development, reproducibility, and clear documentation, following industry-standard practices for version control, experiment tracking, and code organization.
